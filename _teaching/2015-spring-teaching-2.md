At Washington State University I helped teach general biology as part of my teaching assistantship. The majority of work consisted of giving a mini-lecture on the 
relevant weekly laboratory subject and then overseeing the students work through the laboratory material. I was required to lead two laboratory sections and assist 
with one every week. This TA work helped me develop the skills necessary to teach complex biological concepts (e.g. DNA replication, osmosis, evolution) 
to people who were first year students and not biology majors.
