Teaching assistant in the cancer genomics module (MA5107) at the University of Galway. This course is part of the 
curriculum for the biomedical genomics master's program at the Universty of Galway. I was tasked with overseeing, 
administrating, and designing the practicals. This included helping students with subjects like: high-performance 
computing, R, Python, variant calling, signature detection, and much more.
