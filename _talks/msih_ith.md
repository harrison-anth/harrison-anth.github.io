This talk shared research that was published with my adviser on microsatellite instability detection tools used in next-generation sequencing data. We found 
very interesting results, most notably that microsatellite instability tools did not have the same performance across different sequencing types, and that 
some tools, despite literature stating otherwise, had very low performance in general.
