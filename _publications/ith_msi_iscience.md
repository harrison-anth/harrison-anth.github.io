In this article, we identified MSI at the single-cell level. This was done by
creating a novel computational pipeline that makes use of machine learning tools known 
to work with single-cell RNA sequencing data. From there we developed methods to
quanitfy intratumoral heterogeneity in MSI status with statistical tests and by inferring
subclonality. Our most notable result is that intratumoral heterogeneity in MSI status is
more common than previously thought and most individuals in the study had both MSI-H and
MSS subclones regardless of established IHC/PCR status. This has the potential to be
largely impactful in the field because intratumoral heterogeneity is known to complicate
biomarker interpretation and contributes to primary treatment resistance, both of which are
known issues surrounding the implementation of MSI as a clinical biomarker.
