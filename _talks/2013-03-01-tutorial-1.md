In this tutorial, I described how to use hierarchical F-statistics (Wright, 1931) to explore genetic variation in a population. 
This tutorial explored different populations of hippogryphs, and what could be discerned by determining if variation was 
structured at the individual level (FIS), the regional level (FSR), or at the site level (FST). Also briefly discussed is the 
idea of genetic rescue.
