Hi, my name is Harrison Anthony and welcome to my website. Here you will find information about my current research projects. I am a final year PhD student at the 
University of Galway. My general research interests lie in cancer 
evolution, tumor heterogeneity, and biomarker detection. These themes are present throughout my current
research project which centers on microsatellite instability -- a biomarker used in precision medicine for cancer treatment. 
Notably, I have benchmarked the leading methods for detecting it in next-generation sequencing data and have created a 
novel pipeline that measures heterogeneity in the biomarker at the single-cell level. While much more has been done 
(see the projects section of the website), these two portions of my thesis showcase my abilities as a bioinformatician and 
biologist.

See updates on my journey below, and thank you for visiting my website.
