title: "Intratumoral heterogeneity in microsatellite instability status at single cell
resolution"

excerpt: 'Currently MSI-H is tested and treated as a dichotomous biomarker. However, there are
reports of low response rate and inherent treatment resistance when used to help guide 
immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. These two phenomena are known to occur when a tumor 
has subclonal differences (intratumoral heterogeneity). We hypothesize based on this, that 
not all cancer cells within a tumor will be MSI-H or MSS but can be heterogeneous for 
the biomarker at the single cell level. In this study, we investigate this hypothesis by 
analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data with a robust, novel computational pipeline that 
we have made publicly available to facilitate future research efforts in this area.
