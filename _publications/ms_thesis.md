'This thesis aimed to address the genetic paradox of invasion using a non-model organism (the New Zealand Mudsnail). We compared the genetic diversity of invasion North American
populations to see if that could account for their successful invasive history. Interestingly, we found some evidence of genetic differentiation between populations despite these 
populations sharing a recent common invasion history and clonal lineage.'
