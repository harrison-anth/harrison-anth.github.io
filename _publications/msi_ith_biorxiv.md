title: "Intratumoral heterogeneity in microsatellite instability status at single cell 
resolution"
collection: publications
category: preprints
permalink: /publication/msih_ith
excerpt: 'In this preprint, we identified MSI at the single cell level. This was done by 
creating a novel computational pipeline that uses machine learning tools that have been 
tested to work with single-cell RNA sequencing data. From there we developed methods to 
quanitfy intratumoral heterogeneity in MSI status with statistical tests and by inferring 
subclonality. Our most notable result is that intratumoral heterogeneity in MSI status is
more common than previously thought and most individuals in the study had both MSI-H and 
MSS subclones regardless of established IHC/PCR status. This has the potential to be 
largely impactful in the field because intratumoral heterogeneity is known to complicate 
biomarker interpretation and contributes to primary treatment resistance, both of which are 
known issues with using MSI as a biomarker.'
